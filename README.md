# RULE OF THE GAME
**You have been given a question you have to answer in YES or NO Then We divide players based on yes and no, Let's assume there are 20 players 11 chose yes other 9 choose no then the players who choose No will move to the next round and then the 9 players will be given new question and the process continues whoever group is in minority wins and moves to the next round and the last players wins**
**If two players are remaining then they both win cause then we can't pick who is in the minority it's either 0 or both yes/no numbers are 1**
**If Yes and No has the same number of players then all players move to the next round**
